More than 700,000 Brits visited last year, making the UK Australia's fourth largest source of tourists. They stayed more than a month on average and each spent about $5000.There are some concerns the pro-Australia message could be blunted because the ads are airing at the same time as confronting footage of the New South Wales and Victoria bushfire crisis lead major news bulletins across Britain.Kylie Minogue fronts the Matesong campaign in the biggest Tourism Australia investment in the UK for more than a decade. The usually positive coverage of Sydney's New Year's Eve fireworks was pushed aside on Tuesday as UK broadcasters joined the Australian debate about whether the event should have proceeded and what impact climate change has had on the infernos.Asked about any impact on the effectiveness of the pro-Australia messaging, Birmingham said the campaign was scheduled many months in advance and the clash could not be avoided."We also have to acknowledge that as devastating as the fires are - and they are horrific for the communities - that's not [occurring in] every square inch of the Australian land mass and we have to continue to support those communities that rely upon tourism," he said.Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham is thrilled with the Matesong campaign.Credit: Alex Ellinghausen"Even for those fire affected communities, we are talking about targeting tourists today that will make a booking to travel to those areas in six, 12 and 24 months time and that's really important."The $15 million spend on Matesong is the largest investment Tourism Australia has made in the UK in more than a decade.SaveLog in, register or subscribe to save articles for later.License this articleTourismTradeUKSimon BirminghamBrexitBevan Shields is the Editor of The Sydney Morning Herald.Connect via Twitter or email.Most Viewed in WorldLoadingFrom our partnersLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentAdvertisementThe Sydney Morning HeraldTwitterFacebookInstagramRSSOur SitesThe Sydney Morning HeraldThe AgeBrisbane TimesWAtodayThe Australian Financial ReviewDomainDriveClassifiedsTributesCelebrationsPlace your adCommercial Real EstateThe Sydney Morning HeraldContact & supportAdvertise with usNewslettersAccessibility guideSitemapPhoto salesPurchase front pagesContent licensingWork with usTerms of usePrivacy policyPress CouncilCharter of Editorial IndependenceProducts & ServicesSubscription packagesMy accountSubscriber FAQsDelivery statusToday’s PaperGood Food GuideDaily Crosswords & SudokuCopyright © 2024Subscribe
