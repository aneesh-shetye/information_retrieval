COLORADO SPRINGS â€” Colorado Springs police are looking for a good samaritan who helped a police officer save a woman's life.According to a post on CSPD's Facebook, on Sunday December 15 around 1:30 p.m. at the intersection of Janitell Road and South Circle, one officer was transporting someone to jail when they suffered a medical emergency. The officer immediately jumped into action and started performing life-saving measures on the side of the road. Police then say a person stopped to help the officer. Thanks to their assistance and quick action, the officer and citizen were able to save the womanâ€™s life. Police say in the middle of the situation, between fire and the ambulance arriving, the community member left the scene and police did not get his name.In the Facebook post, CSPD says "we would like to personally thank you for your brave actions. You saved a life."
