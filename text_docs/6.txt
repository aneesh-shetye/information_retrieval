Protesters angered by recent US airstrikes targeting an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia have attacked the American embassy compound in Baghdad.
US troops fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that got into a reception area in the compound, which is in the capital's heavily fortified Green Zone.
A guard post on the street nearby was also set alight.
US President Donald Trump accused Iran of "orchestrating" the attack and said it would be "held fully responsible".
Iran denied this, and condemned the "audacity" of the US in blaming Tehran.
At least 25 fighters died when the US bombed bases associated with the Kataib Hezbollah militia in western Iraq and eastern Syria on Sunday.
