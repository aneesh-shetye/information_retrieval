As commissioner of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, one of my top priorities is to connect Alaskans with job opportunities. A recent op-ed in the ADN, written by two fellow military veterans, Kyle Kaiser and Brandon McGuire, misrepresented the truth about my work as your commissioner.In their op-ed, Mr. McGuire and Mr. Kaiser asserted that proposed changes in regulation “would wreak havoc on Alaska’s construction apprenticeships, destabilize Alaska business environment and kill jobs.”I’d like to set the record straight.The truth is that the proposed regulatory change is more about strengthening the economy and expanding opportunity for individual Alaskans. The proposal will not affect the current career pathways available for federally approved apprenticeships for electricians and plumbers. The required 8,000 hours in a federally approved apprenticeship remains unchanged.The proposal would allow a new career pathway for individuals not enrolled in an apprenticeship program. The new pathway would require 12,000 hours of work experience subject to the applicable code. This would, for example, allow trainees the opportunity to use hours achieved through Alaska’s premiere vocational training center, AVTEC, toward the 12,000-hour requirement. It will allow individuals enrolled in state or federal education programs practical code installation work and real-world experience as a part of their course of study.Upon completion of the 12,000 hours, individuals would be required to pass the same extensive four-hour exam in order to obtain a journeyman certificate of fitness license.There’s something else. Currently, individuals from states, such as Florida, where registered apprenticeship is not required, can be eligible to take the journeyman test in Alaska after documenting 8,000 hours of on-the-job training. This creates an unfair playing field for Alaskans. Our proposal levels that playing field. With the change, all non-apprenticeship trainees, whether Alaskans or people coming from states like Florida, would be required to complete the same 12,000 hours.ADVERTISEMENTAs Alaskans, we have so much to gain when we work together. I appreciate the ideas that are being shared, and I continue to welcome and encourage your constructive comments on the proposal. For more information, please go to the commissioner subsection of the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development website.To all fellow veterans, I honor your service and will continue to work to expand training and job opportunities for you and your families. In 2006, training opportunities were restricted solely to federally registered apprenticeship programs. Under the proposed regulations, Alaskans will have additional opportunities beyond registered apprenticeship to gain experience as a trainee in the electrical and plumbing trades in Alaska.Tamika L.
