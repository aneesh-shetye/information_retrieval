We predict there is a 55 per cent chance that Mr. Trump will be re-elected.Marco Bello/ReutersShareBookmarkPlease log in to bookmark this story.Log InCreate Free AccountA year ago at this time, we correctly predicted the Trudeau Liberals would be re-elected, and that the new government was likely to be a minority. We also correctly prophesied that the People’s Party of Canada would not win the 12 seats needed for official party status – but we mistakenly said the same about the Bloc Québécois.We were right, and playing it safe, when we said Alberta’s NDP government had a low probability of re-election; we threw up an air ball when we gave the Toronto Raptors only a 25-per-cent chance of winning the NBA championship. We correctly predicted Theresa May would not end the year as British prime minister; we incorrectly predicted that, by now, Brexit would have already happened.And we were right when we said U.S. President Donald Trump would be impeached, yet would end 2019 still in office. We were wrong in expecting that his Senate trial would have already concluded by now.So what does this year have in store? The Globe and Mail editorial board’s crack team of odds-makers is once again ready to make book on the likelihood of various occurrences, or non-occurrences, in 2020.
