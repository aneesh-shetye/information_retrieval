                                            At the invitation of the Monroe Temple Adult Education Committee and the Community Relations Council of the Jewish Federation of Greater Orange County, Shannon Wong will speak about advocacy priorities of the New York Civil Liberties Union at 11 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 12, at the Monroe Temple of Liberal Judaism. Topics will include criminal justice reform, supporting immigrants, fighting hate and ensuring voting rights. A question and answer period will follow the talk. As chapter director of the Lower Hudson Valley New York Civil Liberties Union, Wong organizes legal, educational and community outreach. Her experience with legislative advocacy contributed to passage of paid family leave and public defense reform in New York State. Prior to joining NYCLU, Wong was an Orange County legislator and led campaigns to limit the shackling of pregnant women in jail and to prevent the expansion of asset forfeiture. She also served as legislative director for the YMCA’s of New York State and as the policy and communication specialist for the New York Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Wong holds a master’s degree in social work with a focus on public policy and community organizing. Wong’s talk will serve as an introduction to a variety of upcoming discussions co-sponsored by the Monroe Temple of Liberal Judaism and the Jewish Federation of Greater Orange County on timely topics such as reproductive and immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, gun violence and social activism. All members of the Orange County community are welcome. Light refreshments will be served. Call 845-783-2626 to RSVP for childcare during the program or for more information.
