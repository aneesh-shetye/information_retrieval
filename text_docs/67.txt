Privacy NoticeWe will wake up to a new decade tomorrow. And while the 2010s brought us innovations in areas such as technology, transport and music, what could the 2020s offer? The Daily Star spoke to leading futurist Dr Ian Pearson - who correctly predicted the invention of the text message - about what we can expect by the end of this decade. “I think we will see more spectacular improvements in things such as robotics and artificial intelligence. “I think drones will become smarter. For example, I think they’ll be able to fly themselves and hold a position. “I expect to see lots of insect-sized drones that can be used for ­monitoring and surveillance. “Also, at the moment people use selfie sticks, but instead people could have a drone a couple of metres in front of them and a couple more at the side taking a bunch of shots from different angles. 

  “I think we will also see augmented reality devices making an appearance on the market, where people will wear a headset or something the same size as your glasses, that will do the job of your phone but project virtual images – for example, of items or celebrities – straight on to your retina, removing the need for a mobile. “By 2030 augmented reality contact lenses may even be available.” “Lab-grown meat is coming, although I don’t think it will come in vast quantities during the 2020s. “It’s a technology that is developing quite slowly. “Even though veganism became a big trend in the 2010s, I don’t think stem cell meat will replace regular meat fully at the end of this new ­decade, but it could be something that happens by 2050. “Some people have become vegan for health reasons, but we’ve already seen some studies that showed red meat being unhealthy have been ­debunked, so there’s a possibility they could switch back and veganism could be a passing fad. 

 “It’s been a bit of an overhyped technology, but 3D printing may have a role in food as you could have 3D printed kitchen items or cake ­decorations, for example.” “We’ve seen a lot of development in this area, especially in terms of fibres. Already, companies are using clever manufacturing techniques to turn objects such as coconut and sweetcorn husks into fabrics. “These are also more sustainable items, as people ­become increasingly ­concerned about the ­environment. “We may see people wearing clothes that are resistant to stains or stop you sweating much. “What is most exciting for me is the tech that is built into it. “By 2030 you could have people wearing clothes that change colour, have patterns on that move like a video or Christmas jumpers that have a mini light show built in.” 

 “You may see hypersonic jets, which are currently in development with the aim of being used by the military, brought in that could get people from London to Sydney in just four-and-a-half hours, and London to New York in two hours. “If people carry on being very ­concerned about the environment, they may take fewer foreign holidays by plane. “However, virtual reality wouldn’t replace holidays like in the film Total Recall, people won’t go into a VR landscape for two weeks. "But what it’ll be used for will be a way of ­exploring the rooms of a resort or hotel you’re considering booking, or taking a quick look at the area, so it’ll be a tool for decision-making. “People can also use VR – virtual reality – to try out activities such as skiing or snowboarding.” “We are likely to see more people using voice-activated technology to do things such as switching off all the lights or switching on the security. “There could also be smart heating, that will heat the person rather than heat the room using either smart fabrics or specially-directed infrared beams. 

 “Hi-res or virtual displays could also replace paintings, and ovens and microwaves could be programmed to ‘talk’ to food packaging to get cooking instructions. “By 2050, I’d imagine that androids would do most of the cooking and cleaning in people’s homes. “However, there is a chance that people could hack into ‘smart’ ­objects like your fridge or microwave to steal information about you – that could be a major concern by 2030.” “We’ve all been reading about the self-driving cars for the last few years, and they are making a lot of progress. I imagine there will be some on the roads by 2030. “They are currently very expensive, at least £30,000, but people will build driverless pods for £300-400. “Some city centres will be ­designed to have driverless pod systems. People could get in and be dropped off exactly where they want. “It also increases social inclusivity. If people can be driven where they need to be, they may leave home more often and get involved in their community. Ten years is a long time in tech, so it is feasible.”  ●  See www.futurizon.com Story SavedYou can find this story in  My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.Follow Daily StarFacebookTwitterCommentMore OnArtificial IntelligenceDroneHypersonicMilitary
