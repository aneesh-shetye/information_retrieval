Privacy Notice The granddaughter of Italian tyrant Benito Mussolini has triggered another vicious feud with Celtic fans after threatening a supporter with a noose.  Rangers beat their hated Old Firm rivals at Celtic Park for the first time in nine years on Sunday.  Ryan Kent and Nikola Katic were both on the scoresheet as Rangers won 2-1 after Odsonne Edouard levelled the scores. After the game, Alessandra Mussolini - granddaughter of Italy's wartime fascist dictator Benito - tweeted: "But then who won? #OldFirmDerby," before deleting the post. In response, a supporter tweeted a gif of a noose at Alexandra, who hit back with the sickening taunt: "For your family, next year." 


 The noose refers to the death of Mussolini, who was killed by anti-fascist forces in the final days of World War Two in 1945. He was shot dead before being strung up and hung upside down outside a petrol station near Milan.  In October, Celtic fans clashed with Lazio supporters during a Europa League game at Celtic Park.  Lazio have a large fascist following, and some home fans displayed a banner showing Mussolini's dead body hanging with the message: "Follow your leader".

  Former MEP Alessandra reacted furiously to the poster and called on the fans responsible to be prosecuted. "Whoever exposes a photo or drawing of my grandfather hanging upside down commits an act of violence, which should be pursued," she said. "I want to propose a new law of the crime of Ducephobia which does not yet exist but which I want to include in our judiciary." 

 Meanwhile, ex-Celtic star John Hartson has criticised Rangers boss Steven Gerrard for failing to shake his counterpart Neil Lennon's hand properly after the game. The Liverpool ace celebrated enthusiastically as his team beat their rivals on their home turf for the first time in nine years, screaming into the camera and embracing his players. But former Wales international Hartson was critical of Gerrard for how he "slapped" Rogers' hand instead of shaking it properly. "I thought the handshake was slightly wrong," Hartson told talkSPORT. "I thought he slapped Neil's hand and he slapped John Kennedy's hand." 

 He added: "I thought Stevie would have shook hands, man to man, looked them in the eye. "But it was almost like a high-five, a slap and he walked away. "It's not a criticism, he was obviously delighted to get the three points and his team played very well. "That was the only thing that I was a little surprised about that he didn't shake the guys' hands." 

 The game saw a number of controversial moments, many centred around Rangers' fiery Colombian striker Alfredo Morelos. Morelos was sent off at the end of the game for a second bookable offence after he was judged to have dived in the penalty area in the dying moments of the game. As he walked off, he appeared to make a throat-cutting motion towards the home fans. 

 There was a further incident earlier, with Celtic's Ryan Christie seeming to grab Morelos' crotch as the striker skipped past him. On Tuesday, Christie was handed a two-match ban for his actions.Story SavedYou can find this story in  My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.Follow Daily StarFacebookTwitterCommentMore OnCeltic FCRangers FCEuropa League
